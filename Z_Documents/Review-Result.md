Guideline 2.3.2 - Performance - Accurate Metadata

We noticed that your promotional image to be displayed on the App Store does not sufficiently represent the associated promoted in-app purchase and/or win back offer. Specifically, we found the following issue with your promotional image:

 – You submitted duplicate or identical promotional images for different promoted in-app purchase products and/or win back offers. 

 – Your promotional image is a screenshot taken from your app.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please revise your promotional image to ensure it is unique and accurately represents the associated promoted in-app purchase and/or win back offer. 


Guideline 2.3.10 - Performance - Accurate Metadata

We noticed your submission includes irrelevant references to your app’s development process. 
￼
Specifically, your screenshots includes debug banners.

Since apps on the App Store should be ready for users, they should not include references to the development process.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please review your submission and remove all references to the development process from your app and its metadata, including the app description, promotional text, What's New info, previews, and screenshots.
